				<p>I'm currently using this website as part of a graded skills-based assessment, so right now it's mostly a mishmash of technical requirements. The site is under heavy construction, and I plan on improving it further after the SBA.</p>
				<p>For the HTML, I already had a solid foundation to work with since this site began with me tinkering with A-Frame and was expanded with a portfolio exercise that was assigned prior to the SBA. Making the required third page was as simple as tossing in a homepage to unite the two. The table requirement was met with the "Skills" section on the portfolio. For the dropdown, I converted the A-Frame Lab link to a menu for experimental pages.</p>
				<p>The navbar is fetched from /views/nav.html with a simple XMLHttpRequest. This allows me to update the navbar without having to dig through every page. I had some trouble getting this to work with scripts, so I just left one hardcoded navbar on the <a href="https://dandykong.github.io/aframe-lab/">A-Frame Lab</a> to save myself the trouble of implementing a conditional Select Avatar button.</p>
				<p>I never could find two good uses for forms, so hopefully this doesn't count off too much.</p>
				<p>As for CSS... Where do I even begin? I put a ton of work into the page style, to the point that early commits labeled my landing page as a CSS project before I merged everything into a single repo. I met this requirement without even paying much attention to it. Flexboxes may have been optional, but I use them extensively because I find them much easier to work with.</p>
				<p>Most of the Javascript on this page is just a handful of stub scripts aside from my attempts at creating an avatar loader in A-Frame. It's a bit sparse, but I was able to check off the whole list. Since I do plan on using this site even after the SBA is over, I included a few technologies beyond the scope of the assignment such as Open Graph and Schema. Open Graph can be tested by linking the page somewhere (you can even post it privately or message yourself) but the Schema is a bit harder to test since it doesn't do much on obscure sites like this one.</p>
